cat << EOF
Irssi is a modular IRC client for UNIX that currently has only text mode user
interface, but 80-90% of the code isn't text mode specific, so other UIs could
be created pretty easily. Also, Irssi isn't really even IRC specific anymore,
there's already working SILC and ICB modules available. Support for other
protocols like ICQ and Jabber could be created some day too.
